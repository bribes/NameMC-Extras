# NameMC Extras (Beta)
A Firefox Extension that adds many features to NameMC currently work in progress.

If you want to install on Firefox since we currently don't have it released on the official store so it is extremely unstable and you have to reactivate it every time you launch the browser.

- Press on the green Code button and press download ZIP or just click [here](https://github.com/bribes/NameMC-Extras/archive/refs/heads/firefox.zip)

[To add to Firefox follow these steps.](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/temporary-installation-in-firefox/)

Rewrite of NameMC+ currently only adds account types and creation dates and removes ads.
