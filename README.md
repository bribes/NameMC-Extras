# NameMC Extras (Beta)
A Firefox Extension that adds many features to NameMC currently work in progress.

If you want to install on Firefox since we currently don't have it released on the official store it is extremely unstable and you have to reactivate it every time you launch the browser.

Same installation as NameMC+

Rewrite of NameMC+ currently only adds account types and creation dates.
